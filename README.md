# malloclab
Malloc Lab: Writing a Dynamic Storage Allocator 

# Introduction
In this lab you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C programs, that is, your own version of the malloc, free,
realloc, and calloc functions. You are encouraged to explore the design space creatively and implement an allocator that
is correct, efficient and fast.
# Logistics
This is an individual project. You should do this lab on one of the class machines.
# Hand Out Instructions
Start by copying malloclab-handout.tar from embedded.cnu.ac.kr server to a protected directory in which you plan to
do your work. Then give the command: tar xvf malloclab-handout.tar. This will cause a number of files to be unpacked
into the directory.
The only file you will be modifying and turning in is mm.c, which contains your solution. The mdriver.c program is a
driver program that allows you to evaluate the performance of your solution. Use the command make to generate the
driver code and run it with the command ./mdriver.
